A Spring Boot &amp; Spring Security Walkthrough


OAuth 2.0 implementation in a project involves integrating an open standard for access delegation, commonly used for token-based authentication and authorization in applications. It allows users to grant third-party access to their server resources without exposing their credentials. OAuth 2.0 works by providing access tokens to third-party clients after successful user authentication, typically through external providers like Google, GitHub, etc. This implementation improves security by centralizing user authentication and providing controlled access, making it a widely accepted method for secure and efficient user authentication in web and mobile applications.
